                <li>
                    Examples of code were bitwise operations are required, what does it mean to use low-level programming with on-off states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why would NaN === NaN come back as false? Isn't it just saying that overall it is not a number?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Chapter 3:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is the advantage of using Sets, when there are such restrictions as removing duplicate values and the inability to find by Index?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are weakMaps and weakSets primarily used for?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Chapter 4:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Interesting that all functions, anonymous included, have a read only name available, and is helpful when debugging programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Default parameters are new to me, I haven't used them before but can be quite useful. Important to remember that any default parameters MUST be placed after any others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is hoisting going to become an outdated practice? Already with var it is not recommended and for functions, it may be better just to define the function first anyway.
