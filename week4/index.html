                    Biggest issue I am having this week is regarding final instructions for the Quiz Dojo stated in chapter 15 of the reading. after following directions, the code does not seem to want to build/compile. After correcting the first error, which seemed to be including "--colors" in the scripts part of package.json, when further trying to build, it states that the plug-in "BabiliPlugin.apply" compliler.plugin is not a function. I will continue to try and see if I can figure out this error, and see if I can get my Dojo to function again.
